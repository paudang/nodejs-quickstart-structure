  # This job simply generates a JSON array [0, 1, ..., 31] to allow dynamic matrix size if we change it later,
  # or we can just hardcode it. Generating it ensures we run exactly the number of tests we have.
  # However, for simplicity and stability, since we know we have 32 tests (2*2*2 Clean + 2*3*2*2 MVC = 8 + 24 = 32),
  # we will use a setup job to output the matrix.
